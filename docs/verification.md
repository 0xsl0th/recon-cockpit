# Verification record

## Mac handoff — 9 September 2026

Environment: macOS/Darwin arm64, local Python 3.11 virtual environment.
Branch: `feature/secure-agent-m1`.

Actually executed:

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` | **335 passed, 5 skipped** |
| `.venv/bin/python -m recon_cockpit.secure_agent --mock --dry-run` | `approval_required`, `dry_run`, explicitly labeled deterministic mock |
| `.venv/bin/python -m recon_cockpit.secure_agent --mock --fixture --execute` without TTY | Blocked: `noninteractive_approval_required` |
| `.venv/bin/python scripts/secure_agent_linux_demo.py` | Blocked: `isolation_unavailable`, Linux required |
| `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q recon_cockpit/secure_agent scripts` | Passed |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

The passing tests comprise 149 existing workflow tests, 104 strict-model/policy
tests, 57 controller/approval/audit/CLI tests, and 25 portable worker/backend tests.
Portable backend tests use controlled subprocesses or test doubles and do not
establish namespace or firewall enforcement.

The **five real Linux integration cases were skipped**, not passed. They cover
normal HTTP, malicious fixture output, output limits, deadlines, and redirects;
each also attempts direct sockets to listening forbidden IP/port witnesses.
No amd64 Linux, Kali, real kernel firewall, capability-drop, or seccomp success
has been established in this session. No Docker-based isolation test was run.

## Required Kali amd64 follow-up

Follow [the handover](handover-kali.md). Record `uname -m`, kernel/distribution,
Python, Bubblewrap and nftables versions, exact commands, test totals, failures
and any fixes. Do not replace a failed isolation check with a mock, an execution
fallback, root execution, broad mounts, or disabled enforcement. Repeat affected
tests after fixing implementation defects, then update this record with actual
evidence. Keep portable and integration results distinguishable.

After all integration cases pass, exercise the human approval CLI in a real
terminal and retain private JSONL evidence of one approved execution. A test
calling the controller's internal approval store proves grant mechanics but is
not a human approval demonstration.
