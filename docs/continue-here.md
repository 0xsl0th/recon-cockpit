# Continue here — 23 September 2026

## Read this first

This development checkpoint never resumes an assessment or restores approvals.

**R1, R2 and the smallest R3 discovery-to-HTTP slice are merged. The first R4
card/engine is implemented on `feature/secure-agent-workflow`, pending review and
merge.** Read [workflow-assessment.md](workflow-assessment.md),
[verification.md](verification.md) and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Inspect Git and
current PR checks before more work. Do not restart R1/R2/R3 or repeat their merges.

Recovery found the branch clean at `75ebb8d`, with no pending implementation
edits and no Git corruption after the battery failure. Saved conversation history
confirmed one TCP connection to the approved owned service as the intended R3
step. At recovery, main still matched `75ebb8d` and its hosted CI was successful.
R3 was subsequently reviewed and merged with explicit operator authorization.

## Saved state

- Workspace: `/home/sloth/Code/recon-cockpit`, Kali Linux x86_64, normal user.
- Current branch: `feature/secure-agent-workflow`, based on main `1086301`.
  Use `git log -1` and `git status` for the latest implementation checkpoint.
- [PR #9](https://github.com/0xsl0th/recon-cockpit/pull/9) is **open as a draft**,
  not merged. Implementation `9bcb8b2` passed all ten branch/PR portable jobs
  across Ubuntu Python 3.11–3.14 and macOS Python 3.14. The following publication
  checkpoint changes documentation only; inspect the latest PR checks separately.
- R4 adds a repository-authored versioned card, immutable deterministic
  decisions, durable proposal/terminal events and independent read-only replay.
  The CLI selector is `--workflow-assessment`; existing R2/R3 modes remain.
- Full R4 verification: **2,134 portable / 109 real Linux tests passed**, no
  selected failures, errors or skips. Compile, dependency and whitespace checks
  passed. See verification.md for commands, timings and reviewed limitations.
- R4 JUnit: `/tmp/recon-workflow-portable.xml` and
  `/tmp/recon-workflow-linux.xml`. Temporary evidence may disappear on reboot.
- Private R4 sample: `.secure-agent/r4-example-a/report.md` and `report.json`,
  plus `.secure-agent/r4-example-audit.jsonl`. The real CLI validated case a
  with three linked executions, three decisions and a terminal explanation.
  Read-only CLI inspection preserved every file's bytes and modification time.
  The explicit unattended owned-fixture policy is
  `/tmp/recon-r4-owned-fixture-policy.json`; this is not human approval evidence.
- [PR #8](https://github.com/0xsl0th/recon-cockpit/pull/8): reviewed head
  `124300a`, merged as `b1c7b67` on 22 September with operator authorization.
  The merge tree exactly matches the reviewed files. Implementation: `ad30297`.
  All ten branch/PR checks and all five post-merge main jobs passed; see
  verification.md. Inspect current main checks for the documentation checkpoint.
- Bounded premerge reviews covered isolation/authority, workflow/schema and
  evidence/recovery. No blockers were found; fresh focused checks passed.
  The existing full portable/Linux results remain valid for the production code.
- Initial hosted CI exposed a macOS assumption in a new portable refusal test.
  The test now explicitly exercises both Linux host-namespace refusal and
  non-Linux refusal. Production files and Linux verification are unchanged.
- Previous R3 verification: **1,977 portable tests and 96 real Linux
  integrations**, zero selected failures/errors/skips. Compile, dependency and
  whitespace checks passed. See the exact commands/timing in verification.md.
- JUnit: `/tmp/recon-discovery-portable.xml` and `/tmp/recon-discovery-linux.xml`.
  Temporary evidence can disappear on reboot; measured results are documented.
- Private sample: `.secure-agent/r3-example-a/report.md` and `report.json` plus
  `.secure-agent/r3-example-audit.jsonl`. It validates seeded case a using an
  explicit unattended owned-fixture demo policy, not human approval. Read-only
  CLI inspection found no issues and changed no file bytes or mtimes.
- [PR #6](https://github.com/0xsl0th/recon-cockpit/pull/6): reviewed R1
  `cfde4ed`, merged as `07af513` on 17 September.
- [PR #7](https://github.com/0xsl0th/recon-cockpit/pull/7): reviewed R2
  `1312acf`, updated as `33edceb` without file changes, merged as `f85aaa9`.
  All ten premerge branch/PR checks and five subsequent main jobs passed.
- [PR #5](https://github.com/0xsl0th/recon-cockpit/pull/5) is merged as `bf3a359`.
  Prior R2 verification was 1,849 portable / 78 Linux; do not present it as R3.
- Old `/tmp/recon-pr2-review` and `/tmp/recon-pr3-review` worktrees disappeared
  after an earlier reboot; their stale registrations were not pruned.
- SSH push authentication is still unavailable. Explicit HTTPS push with the
  GitHub CLI credential helper succeeded; no credentials entered artifacts.

## Implemented R3 scope

`--discovery-assessment a` selects one fixed `tcp_connect` action, then gates the
existing two-GET workflow using actual evidence. The explicit discovery executor
only permits the owned `127.0.0.1:8080` topology. TCP uses one second and reserves
1,024 output bytes, with no payload, banner, DNS, retry or port list. Original
fixture/routed HTTP modes reject TCP; the old policy remains HTTP-only. A separate
example policy allows both capabilities and requires fresh approvals.

Each action creates a fresh namespace with the same seeded topology. Reachability
does not prove HTTP identity or persistent service continuity. Three-step defaults
reserve 3,072 tool bytes; the broker separately reserves three calls/3,072 output
tokens. Reports link TCP and both HTTP observations, remain drafts, and preserve
read-only crash inspection without execution or grant restoration. R3 is not a
multi-service/Nmap adapter, general capability registry or workflow engine.

## Implemented first R4 slice

One card, `owned-discovery-http-assessment` version `1`, binds the existing
TCP-to-HTTP path to exact actions, parser gates and evidence requirements. Each
decision is durably recorded before any synthetic provider exchange. Execution
starts require a matching preceding proposal; reports distinguish proposals
from executions and explain evidence, approval, failure and budget stops.
The manifest and every decision bind the canonical card digest.

`owned-workflow-assessment-v1` bundles replay observations from artifacts and
recompute decisions during inspection. Corrupt, reordered, missing or unfinished
evidence remains inconclusive. There is no resumption of an assessment, dynamic
card loading, external knowledge import or new execution capability. Existing
per-action fresh namespaces remain; persistent topology is subsequent work.

## Intent and constraints

Build authorized pentest workflows with specialist engines inside enforced
security boundaries. Challenge 4, security of autonomous agents, is the focus.
Planning uses synthetic responses.

- Keep live calls and credential lookup disabled. Live work needs reviewed
  operator data/model/credential/spend settings. Real VPN tests remain deferred.
- Use owned fixtures; preserve scope/policy, OS isolation, fresh grants, budgets,
  cancellation/deadlines, audit-before-execution and fail-closed behavior.
- Never connect legacy host execution, arbitrary shell, credentials, broad mounts
  or Docker sockets to agents. Do not change host networking to pass tests.
- Authority/UI/broker/audit/launcher still share a trusted host process. Hashes
  detect inconsistency, not host-owner tampering. R1 callback and R2 HTTP framing
  limits remain documented.
- The operator authorized the completed PR #6/#7/#8 merges. This does not
  authorize future merges, submission, messages, paid calls or external targets.

## Next continuation

1. Inspect this branch and its PR/checks, preserving unrelated work. PR #8 is
   already merged; do not repeat its review, implementation or merge.
2. Review the concrete R4 card/engine PR. Future merging still requires operator
   authorization; the earlier PR #8 approval does not cover this branch.
3. The accepted next development sequence is persistent owned lab, repeatable
   evaluation runner, then separately reviewed live-provider controls. First
   settle the lab lifecycle and executor scope contract; do not silently widen
   the singleton executor or attach the legacy Nmap runner.
4. Keep kernel verification separate from hosted portable CI and record measured
   results/publication state for every slice.

## Recovery and verification

```sh
git status --short --branch
git log -5 --oneline --decorate
git diff --stat
git diff --check
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -m 'not integration' --strict-markers -ra
RECON_LINUX_INTEGRATION=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m integration -v --tb=short
```

Run kernel tests outside the coding sandbox as the normal user. Use fresh audit
and assessment paths. Do not rerun all tests solely to verify saved docs. Inspect
existing bundles without restoring old approvals, deadlines or budgets.

## Remaining decisions

Reference identities are resolved: Enrique Folte, PentestMonkey,
PayloadsAllTheThings, GTFOBins, LOLBAS, HackTricks and Hack The Box. Links and
categories are in the roadmap; do not repeat clarification.

Enrique Folte confirmed that he is the sole human participant and project contact,
with Codex providing development assistance under human review. No additional
members or institutional affiliation are declared. Do not repeat the team question.
Proposal deadline: **15 November 2026**. Final development: **20 May 2027**.
